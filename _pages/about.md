:wave: Hey there! Welcome to the corner of the internet where MRI voxels meet meme-grade wit, and both leave smarter.

I'm an incoming CS PhD student at [JHU](jhu.edu), advised by Prof. [Vishal M. Patel](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/vishal-patel/). I currently work as a Research Engineer for Dr. [Amal Isaiah](isaiahlab.org) at the University of Maryland Institute for Health Computing where I develop ML/AI applications for translational biomedical applications in surgery, radiology, and healthtech infra. 

On the academic side, I also occasionally lecture as an Adjunct Instructor at JHU’s Carey Business School, delivering practical coursework in big data and machine learning for professionals aiming to bridge technical depth with business strategy. My academic origin story started with a master's in biomedical engineering, also from Hopkins, where I learned the fine art of taking really expensive 3D selfies of internal organs via MRI and CT. Turns out there's decent money in professional photography of the human body, as long as you call it "medical imaging."

## Entrepreneurial Detour:

I was also the co-founder of Farmplus, a dairy-tech startup where we built a cool fitbit for cows, snagged 1st place at the 2022 Hopkins New Venture Challenge (HOPSTART) and was subsequently incubated at the JHU Spark Incubator. Check out the BTS story of how that came to be in my blog! 

## Research:

My research interests lie at the intersection of AI, neuroscience and medical imaging. On the technical side, I'm motivated particularly towards applying mechanistic interpretability to understand how LLMs reason and develop internal biases; how we can better represent large medical data manifolds; how we can harmonize heterogeneous non-i.i.d data while maintaining privacy using federated learning; and optimization strategies for LMMs and VLMs. On the clinical front, I'm particularly interested in applying techniques to identify novel biomakers to predict cognitive outcoms based on gross anatomy; and building segmentation models for radiological and surgical applications. 

## IRL:

When the cloud bill and my attention span both time out, I swap keyboards for hand wraps and go a few rounds with a punching bag, an excellent practice for delivering punchlines and dodging null-pointer exceptions. If I’m not sweating through boxing gloves, I’m logging suspicious "cardiovascular endurance tests” on Baltimore’s harbor paths (translation: marathon training, but with strategic pastry stops).

After cardio comes laptop-free creativity - Ableton sessions where film-score strings merge with indian classical instruments like the santoor and sitar, and emerge as something my neighbors describe “formally interesting.” Dinner usually follows, because my smoke alarm doubles as a kitchen timer; and when friends arrive for the food they stay for the impromptu debate on whether prompt engineering and vibe coding should be on my résumé or rap sheet.

Once a month I attempt a full digital detox in the mountains. No Wi-Fi, no federated anything - just me, my playlist, and whatever existential bug reports nature files. It’s amazing how well models converge when the only feedback loop is birdsong telling you to chill.
