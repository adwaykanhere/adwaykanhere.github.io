### Project Codebases

- [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/BioIntelligence-Lab/Flower-Medicalsegmentation?style=social)](https://github.com/BioIntelligence-Lab/Flower-Medicalsegmentation) **Building a Flower application for federated 3D medical image segmentation using MONAI** – A federated learning framework for privacy‑preserving 3D medical image segmentation using Flower and MONAI.
- [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/UM2ii/Better-PediatricCT-segmentation)](https://github.com/UM2ii/Better-PediatricCT-segmentation/blob/main/LICENSE) **An nnUNet-based 3D Segmentation model for segmenting thoracic organs in Pediatric CT** – Fine‑tunes adult-trained segmentation models to perform accurately on pediatric CTs.
- [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/neurodata/df-dn-paper?style=social)](https://github.com/neurodata/df-dn-paper) **When are Deep Networks really better than Decision Forests at small sample sizes, and how?** – My contributions to an ongoing project at the NeuroData Lab at JHU BME on the comparative analysis of decision forests versus deep networks in small-data contexts.
- [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/adwaykanhere/CXR‑Pneumonia_detection?style=social)](https://github.com/adwaykanhere/CXR-Pneumonia_detection) **CXR Pneumonia detection** – Automated pneumonia detection in chest X-rays via deep learning hosted on Streamlit.
- [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/adwaykanhere/DL_FCD?style=social)](https://github.com/adwaykanhere/DL_FCD) **DL_FCD** – Deep-learning-based segmentation of focal cortical dysplasia for epilepsy planning.
- [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/adwaykanhere/FYP?style=social)](https://github.com/adwaykanhere/FYP) **EEG hardware integrated with neural correction models in a brain–computer interface system.** – My undergrad senior project on building a 3D printed head cap for accurate EEG signal acquisition and a deep learning model to predict words from EEG when you subvocalize them. 

### Media

- [**Flower Blog** (Feb 24, 2025)](https://flower.ai/blog/2025-02-24-university-of-maryland-blog-post/) – Coverage of federated learning efforts in medical imaging.
