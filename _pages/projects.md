### Project Codebases

- [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=flat&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/BioIntelligence-Lab/Flower-Medicalsegmentation) **Building a Flower application for federated 3D medical image segmentation using MONAI** – A federated learning framework for privacy‑preserving 3D medical image segmentation using Flower and MONAI.
- [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=flat&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/UM2ii/Better-PediatricCT-segmentation/tree/main) **An nnUNet-based 3D Segmentation model for segmenting thoracic organs in Pediatric CT** – Fine‑tunes adult-trained segmentation models to perform accurately on pediatric CTs.
- [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=flat&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/neurodata/df-dn-paper) **When are Deep Networks really better than Decision Forests at small sample sizes, and how?** – My contributions to an ongoing project at the NeuroData Lab at JHU BME on the comparative analysis of decision forests versus deep networks in small-data contexts.
- [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=flat&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/adwaykanhere/CXR-Pneumonia_detection) **Chest X-Ray based automated Pneumonia detection** – Automated pneumonia detection in chest X-rays via deep learning hosted on Streamlit.
- [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=flat&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/adwaykanhere/DL_FCD) **Deep learning to identify focal cortical dysplasia on brain MRI scans** – Focal Cortical Dysplasia can cause epileptic seizures in patients but can sometimes be completely invisible on MRI (called MR negative FCD). We developed a segmentation model to accurately predict regions of FCD on the brain while training on MR-ve samples as well.
- [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=flat&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/adwaykanhere/FYP) **EEG hardware integrated with neural correction models in a brain–computer interface system.** – My undergrad senior project on building a 3D printed head cap for accurate EEG signal acquisition and a deep learning model to predict words from EEG when you subvocalize them. The goal was to subvocalize words and detect them on EEG as spike potentials which would then interface an Alexa API. Too bad COVID hit then, and we couldn't test it out on folks :(  

### Talks and blogs

- [**Flower Blog** (Feb 24, 2025)](https://flower.ai/blog/2025-02-24-university-of-maryland-blog-post/) – Flower labs covered my experience as part of the Flower Next Pilot Program and our work together in federated medical imaging. 
- **Flower Monthly Invited Talk** – The video version of our Flower‑AI federated learning and clinical imaging workflow as part of the Flower Next Pilot Program Phase 1
