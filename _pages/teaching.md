## Teaching Experience

Since February 2024, I have served as an Adjunct Instructor at Johns Hopkins University's Carey School of Business, where I teach machine-learning methods to master's-level students across multiple programs including Business Analytics, Risk Management, and Financial Engineering. In this role, I have taught Big Data Machine Learning during Spring 2024 to one section of students, and I am currently teaching Practical Machine Learning to two sections in Spring 2025.

My journey in teaching at Johns Hopkins began earlier as a Graduate Teaching Assistant from March 2022 to May 2023, where I focused on enhancing student mastery of machine-learning skills across various quantitative business courses. During this period, I supported more than 36 hands-on machine learning hackathons, serving over 150 students in the Business Analytics and Risk Management programs. This experience involved curating real-world datasets, authoring interactive Jupyter notebooks with starter code, and designing challenging problems that would push students to apply their theoretical knowledge in practical settings.

Throughout my teaching assistant role, I had the opportunity to support a diverse range of courses that spanned the quantitative business curriculum. This progression from teaching assistant to instructor has allowed me to develop a comprehensive understanding of how students learn machine learning concepts and has shaped my approach to making complex quantitative methods accessible and engaging for business students.

### Courses assisted as Graduate Teaching Assistant:

- Big Data Machine Learning (Spring II 2022 & Spring II 2023, Head TA)
- Operations Management (Fall I 2022)
- Data Analytics in R (Fall II 2022)
- Linear Econometrics for Finance (Fall II 2022)
- Python for Data Analytics (Spring I 2023)
- Empirical Finance (Spring II 2023)
